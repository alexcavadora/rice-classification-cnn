# Rice Image Dataset (extrated from Kaggle)

## **Overview**
The **Rice Image Dataset** is a collection of high-resolution images designed for rice grain classification. It contains images of five different rice varieties, making it useful for machine learning applications in agricultural research, food quality assessment, and automated classification systems.

## **Dataset Details**
- **Total Images**: 75,000
- **Number of Classes**: 5
- **Image Size**: 250 Ã— 250 pixels
- **Format**: JPEG
- **Grayscale or RGB**: RGB

## **Classes (Rice Varieties)**
The dataset includes images of the following five types of rice grains:
1. **Arborio**
2. **Basmati**
3. **Ipsala**
4. **Jasmine**
5. **Karacadag**

Each class contains an equal number of images, ensuring balanced data for training machine learning models.

## **Potential Use Cases**
- **Classification Models**: Train deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs) to classify rice varieties.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract texture, shape, and color features for distinguishing different rice types.
- **Quality Assessment**: Identify high-quality vs. low-quality grains using automated inspection systems.
- **Agricultural Research**: Analyze grain characteristics to improve production and processing techniques.
