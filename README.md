# Rice Image Dataset (extrated from Kaggle)

## **Overview**
The **Rice Image Dataset** is a collection of high-resolution images designed for rice grain classification. It contains images of five different rice varieties, making it useful for machine learning applications in agricultural research, food quality assessment, and automated classification systems.

## **Dataset Details**
- **Total Images**: 75,000
- **Number of Classes**: 5
- **Image Size**: 250 Ã— 250 pixels
- **Format**: JPEG
- **Grayscale or RGB**: RGB

## **Classes (Rice Varieties)**
The dataset includes images of the following five types of rice grains:
1. **Arborio**
2. **Basmati**
3. **Ipsala**
4. **Jasmine**
5. **Karacadag**

Each class contains an equal number of images, ensuring balanced data for training machine learning models.

## **Potential Use Cases**
- **Classification Models**: Train deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs) to classify rice varieties.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract texture, shape, and color features for distinguishing different rice types.
- **Quality Assessment**: Identify high-quality vs. low-quality grains using automated inspection systems.
- **Agricultural Research**: Analyze grain characteristics to improve production and processing techniques.

 *Abstract*

Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. A second dataset with 106 features including 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features obtained from these images was used. Models were created by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms for the feature dataset and by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset, and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99.87% for ANN, 99.95% for DNN and 100% for CNN. With the results, it is seen that the models used in the study in the classification of rice varieties can be applied successfully in this field.
